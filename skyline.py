# This problem was recently asked by Facebook:
# Given a list of buildings in the form of (left, right, height), return what the skyline should look like. 
# The skyline should be in the form of a list of (x-axis, height), where xaxis is the next point where there is a change in height starting from 0, and height is the new height starting from the x-axis.

def generate_skyline(buildings):
#        Fill this in.
#            2 2 2
#            2 2 2
#        1 1 2 2 2 1 1
#        1 1 2 2 2 1 1
#        1 1 2 2 2 1 1
# pos: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
    return
print('generate_skyline([(2, 8, 3)')

# Output: [(2, 3), (4, 5), (7, 3), (9, 0)]
